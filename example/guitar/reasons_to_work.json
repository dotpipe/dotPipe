Over the years you've maintained quantities of graciousnesswith a quality of workers. If there were anything I'd change, it'd be security. So what I'm here for, is to ask you for a job. I realize your site is very equipped to handle a very decent deal of attraction. But the modality of it is maybe a bit cold and dry. So I'm offering to make you a dark themed page, that your kindliness can offer to your fans. It's not a secret, but the thing I lust for is the beautiful Gibson. I've never owned one, and that is in itself a test on me that I want to accomplish. Right, yes. After the site is finished. That's when you would pay."
